# Documenting data

## Data diagrams

Data diagram tools like  [Mermaid](https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid#readme) and [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com) 
are useful to document data processing flows and some can be embedded into Markdown files such as a `README.md` file.

By using diagram tools:
* modifications to flowcharts do not have to be re-uploaded with new images every time.
* Markdown syntax is intuitive therefore documentation process is more efficient. 

```{tip}
You may reuse the following source code examples to document your GitHub project repository.
Add the source code in your `README.md` file and make changes to it to document your data flow.
```
