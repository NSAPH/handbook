## GitHub presence

A GitHub organization is a shared account where all organization members can collaborate across many projects at once. NSAPH has five organizations on GitHub meant to help you find and use group resources:

1. [NSAPH Projects](https://github.com/NSAPH-Projects) - Host a GitHub repository for all NSAPH-led member projects; moving forward, all NSAPH member-led projects should have a repository here;
2. [NSAPH](https://github.com/orgs/NSAPH/teams/research) - Can be leveraged to read NSAPH members' private codebases; no new projects should be started here;
3. [NSAPH Software](https://github.com/orgs/NSAPH-Software) - The development of reusable software packages for analysis; 
4. [NSAPH Data Platform](https://github.com/NSAPH-Data-Platform) - Captures all the code that went into creating and maintaining the data platform; 
5. [NSAPH Data Processing](https://github.com/NSAPH-Data-Processing) - Captures the data pipelines for data transformations and aggregation;
6. [NSAPH](https://github.com/NSAPH) - Gathers past projects but will continue to be used for miscellaneous projects that don't belong in the previous categories.
