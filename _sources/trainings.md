# NSAPH Required Trainings

Data Security trainings are a required component of the NSAPH on-boarding process.
We require three trainings:
1. CITI- Social and Behavioral/Biomedical Research Investigators Training
2. CITI- Yearly Data Security/Information Privacy and Security (IPS) Training
3. [Additional NSAPH Data Security Training](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScV_txoDRI5b6bpsnVO6QaAPZJ4xRo2z4VgyXibSxZ55o_AJg/viewform?usp=sf_link)


```{tip}
Please note that if your certification has not yet expired for the trainings mentioned above, you would not be expected to repeat the training. You can merely attach the certificates in the
appropriate box within the NSAPH form.
```

## Social and Behavioral/Biomedical Research Investigators Training

Information about the training and the link to the CITI page can be found [here](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/regulatory-affairs-and-research-compliance/2019/12/10/citi-human-research-training/). Follow the "New CITI Users" instructions if you are a new user.

The following two courses are accepted by the Harvard Longwood Campus Institutional Review Board (IRB), you can choose to complete either one:
1. Human Subject Biomedical Research training
2. Human Subject Social and Behavioral Research training.


```{note}
Please note:
- The training does not have to be done in one sitting, you can save your progress and resume at a later time.
- Once you are done, save your CITI training certificate as a pdf (`First`Name_LastName_CITI`) and upload it to the forms when requested.
- Your CITI certificate should have an expiry date, otherwise it means you haven't completed the required modules.
```

## Yearly Data Security/Information Privacy and Security (IPS) Training

Because our research lab works with sensitive data, the IRB made it a requirement that all researchers complete a yearly Data Security Training on the CITI portal.
Please complete the CITI module "Information Privacy and Security for Researchers” to fulfill this requirement (see below screenshots for more details).

```{note}
Please note:
- The training is 30-45 minutes long and should be renewed every year.
- Once you are done, please save your CITI training certificate as a pdf (`FirstName_LastName_IPS`) and upload it to the forms when requested.
```
