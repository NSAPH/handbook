# NSAPH Projects

[NSAPH Projects GitHub organization](https://github.com/NSAPH-Projects) is a shared account where all NSAPH members 
can collaborate across many projects at once.

The goal is to keep all NSAPH analysis projects at [one location](https://github.com/NSAPH-Projects) to encourage 
internal review, collaboration and reuse. It would also facilitate future data and code curations, migrations, 
and cross-referencing material and documentation.

:::{admonition} New project 
:class: note 
If you are starting a new analysis project, create a repository under [NSAPH Projects](https://github.com/NSAPH-Projects) 
organization on GitHub. You can make contributions to the repository directly, or create a fork under own account.

:::{admonition} Existing project 
:class: note 
If you already have a working git repository under own username, transfer its ownership to 
[NSAPH Projects](https://github.com/NSAPH-Projects). You can do that by clicking the following buttons at your 
repository page: "Settings" -> "Danger Zone" -> "Transfer ownership". Have a look at the 
[official GitHub guidelines](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/transferring-a-repository).
:::

:::{admonition} Published project 
:class: note 
If you have a git repository of a completed project under own username that you reference in a publication, 
do not just transfer ownership to [NSAPH Projects](https://github.com/NSAPH-Projects). In this case, you should:

- Transfer ownership and create a **fork** of the repository under own username; or
- Ask a [NSAPH Projects](https://github.com/NSAPH-Projects) admin to fork your repository. Both repositories should be up-to-date.

This is important so that shared repository URLs are not broken. In this case, do not modify the repository name.
